# Intervals

Using the intervals, you can easily vary the value of a field based on other fields.

To start, add a new interval, then pick the **target field**.
Let's say we want to vary the value of the **price_m2** field which is a price field by the **area** field

The intervals that we used are 0 → 3, 3 → 5, 5 → 7, 7 → ∞.  
This symbol ∞ signifies infinity which means, when area is 7 or greater.

To add intervals, click the plus sign in the top right corner, the module will add a new interval automatically.  
To edit it, click it, then this popup will be displayed
